Look for Food Security Trends in Liptako-Gourma, a Conflict prone area in the Sahel

Objective: assess the food insecurity-conflicts vicious cycle of Liptako-Gourma in order to help the provinces which are more in need of first aid.

Specific objectives:<br>
•Identifying the three most afflicted provinces: the ones with higher percentage of food insecure people.<br>
•Comparing the dimensions of the selected provinces and determining analogies and differences.<br>
•Assessing changes in the dimensions values over the years for the selected provinces and for all Liptako-Gourma


Food insecurity-conflicts vicious cycle Dimensions:<br>
•Food Insecurity                  : percentage of food insecure people<br>
•Food Access                      : food prices<br>
•Food Stability                   : food prices stability<br>
•Conflict Size                    : number of fatalities<br>
•Conflict Severity                : fatalities divided by conflicts<br>
•Internally Displaced People      : number of IDPs
